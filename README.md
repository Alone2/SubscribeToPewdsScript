# SubscribeToPewdsScript
A script for the Digispark USB, which subscribes to pewdiepie. (using Arduino)

You need to add the Line:<br/>
<i>#define KEY_TAB     43</i><br/>
to your Digikeyboard.h File.<br><br>
You can find the file using this Path: <i>ArduinoData\packages\digistump\hardware\avr\1.6.7\libraries\DigisparkKeyboard\Digikeyboard.h</i><br><br>
The ArduinoData folder is normally located in the same place as the Arduino folder.
When you don't know where that is, just go to File->Prefrences (in the Arduino IDE) and the Path will be displayed.<br><br>

If you don't know how to set up your Digispark here is some info:
